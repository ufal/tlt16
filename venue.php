<h2>Venue Address</h2>

<h2>Faculty Building</h2>
<p>
	The venue of TLT 16 (the Computer Science School building, see the left-hand picture below - 
	on the horizon, the Prague Castle (Hradčany) can be seen as well) is in the center of Prague, 
	in the Lesser Town. The building itself has been built in today's shape in the 17th century, 
	and it served as a jesuit monastery. It has a rectangular shape with a small yard in the middle; 
	three wings now belong to the University, and the fourth to the (roman-catholic) church. The church
	is the largest baroque church in Prague (the right-hand picture).

<h2>
Travelling to the Venue
</h2>

<p>
	Prague can be easily reached by air from popular gateways to Europe including London, 
	Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Zurich, Helsinki, Rome, Dubai etc.
	In addition, Prague can be reached by train or car from nearby cities such as Berlin, Dresden, Vienna and Munich.
</p>

<h3>
By Plane
</h3>

<p>
	To get from the <a href="http://www.prg.aero/">Václav Havel Airport Prague (Ruzyně)</a> to the conference venue:
</p>

<h4>
Take an airport taxi
</h4>
<p>
	We suggest to take ONLY the official taxis. Contact counters are located in arrival halls of both terminals.
</p>
<p>
	The fare should not go over CZK 600 (USD 27-30). Taxi drivers should always issue a signed receipt. 
	Ask the driver about the cost beforehand. They usually accept CCs (ask at the stand and the driver), 
	CZK and EUR (not a very favorable exchange rate), but not USD (or least they are not supposed to).
</p>

<h4>
Use public transport
</h4>
<p>
	The preferred route is the following:
</p>

<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Take the bus no. 119 (direction Nádraží Veleslavín) to the terminal stop Nádraží Veleslavín.
		</li>
		<li>
			Then take tram no. 20 (direction <s>Sídliště Barrandov</s> Nádraží Braník) and get off after 12 stops at Malostranské náměstí. 
			(Only valid for those coming Sunday, Jan. 21; starting Jan. 22, 
			you can only go to Malostranska stop (11 stops from Nadrazi Veleslavin) and then have to walk.)
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>
	The journey takes about 50 minutes in total, the fare is CZK 32 (ca. USD 1.45). 
	You can view the journey on Google Maps along with other options (note that special, 
	higher fare applies on the AE bus line and on Student Agency buses). More information 
	about public transport in Prague can be found below.
</p>

<h3>
By Train or Bus
</h3>

<p>
	Taking the train is a convenient option when travelling, e.g., from Berlin or Vienna. 
	Night trains are also a good option esp. from more distant cities like Budapest or Warsaw, but they
	are becoming rare. All long-distance trains arrive to the main railway station (Hlavní nádraží). 
	Trains arriving from Berlin/Dresden stop at the Holešovice station, too. Most long-distance buses 
	arrive at the Florenc bus station.
</p>

<p>
	To get to the venue using public transport (please note the venue is NOT reachable by public transport 
	directly starting Jan. 22 - you 
	will have to walk for about 400m from the Malostranska A metro stop): 
</p>

<h4>
Using a Taxi
</h4>
<p>
	We suggest to take AAA taxis only. Taxi stands are located near all stations 
	(see details for Hlavní nádraží here). The fare should not be over CZK 250-300 (ask about it beforehand).
	You can call them at a short-hand number 14014. UBER is also available.
</p>

<h3>
To the venue by car
</h3>

<p>
	A car is recommended to reach your hotel only. Prague city center has heavy traffic during rush 
	hours and only a few available parking spots.
</p>

<h4>
Parking
</h4>

<p>
	There is a paid car park on rear side of the building, limited to 2 hours of stay.
</p>
<p>
	The nearest underground parking lot at Rudolfinum is about 15 min. walk away from the venue 
	and has the same fee of CZK 60 / hour.
