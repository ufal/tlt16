<p>The Czech Republic is part of the European Union (incl. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement">Schengen border-less region</a>).</p>

<p>If you need a visa for entering the European Union (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement#Schengen_visa">check the map</a>), we can issue a letter of invitation for you.</p>

<p>
<em>
	Note that it can be very difficult to get the visa in the given short timeframe. Contact an embassy of the Czech Republic as soon as possible. It may be easier to get the appointment sooner at embassies from less touristic states, perhaps Slovakia, Poland, Iceland, Slovenia...
</em>
</p>
<p><em>There is an exception for permanent residence permit holders in a member state (not necessarily Schengen). Check for yourself if this could work for you (there are some exclusions but the web does not say which exactly): <a href="http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/en/information_for_aliens/general_visa_information/temporary_stay_in_the_territory_of_the/index.html">http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/en/information_for_aliens/general_visa_information/temporary_stay_in_the_territory_of_the/index.html</a></em></p>

<code>bryanova-at-ufal.mff.cuni.cz</code>:
