<p>TLT serves as a venue for new and ongoing research on the topic of linguistics and treebanks. The 16th edition of TLT will, for the second time, take place in Prague, Czech Republic, at Charles University in the heart of the old city, on 23-24 January 2018.
</p>

<p>For over 15 years now, TLT has served as a venue for new and ongoing high-quality work related to syntactically-annotated corpora, i.e., treebanks; with a focus on all the aspects of treebanking – descriptive, theoretical, formal and computational – but also going beyond treebanks, including other levels of annotation such as frame semantics and similar formalisms, coreference, discourse, named entities or events, to name only a few. 
</p>

<p>Submissions are invited for papers, posters and demonstrations which present research on treebanks and their intersection with linguistics, natural language processing and related fields. 
</p>

<p>
The TLT16 conference is collocated with a <a href="https://typo.uni-konstanz.de/dataprovenance/">Workshop on Provenance and Annotation in Computational Linguistics 2018</a> (Jan. 22, organized by Miriam Butt of Konstanz Univ., Germany) 
and immediately followed by the <a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ac/crh2/">CDH workshop</a>, which takes place 
in Vienna, Austria on January 25-26, 2018.

<h2>Motivation and aims</h2>

<p>Treebanks have proved to be crucial resources for very important NLP applications, such as machine translation and information extraction, as well as supporting resources for various NLP tasks, such as high-quality parsing and POS tagging. 
</p>

<p>More recent trends in treebank-related research have focused on a variety of initiatives, such as annotating deep syntactic, semantic, and syntactic-semantic interface information; (semi)-automatic conversion of existing treebanks into deeper linguistic formats; multilingual and cross-lingual treebanking, including 'language-universal' treebanking; typology and its relation to treebanking; enriching treebanks with additional layers of linguistic annotation as well as incorporating world knowledge; dynamic treebanking involving a close connection between grammar-based parsing and manual annotation; designing web services for observing and exploiting theoretically diverse treebanks; and mapping syntactic and semantic knowledge to Linked Open Data (LOD) information. 
</p>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<p>TLT16 invites the submission of papers, posters and software demonstrations on original and unpublished research on the following topics, including, but not limited to: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Design principles and annotation schemes for treebanks </li>
	<li>The use of treebanks in acquiring linguistic knowledge </li>
	<li>The use of treebanks for NLP applications </li>
	<li>The role of linguistic theories in treebank development </li>
	<li>Treebanks as a knowledge source for linguistic research </li>
	<li>Treebank annotation beyond syntax: semantics, pragmatics and discourse</li>
	<li>Relation of treebanks and lexical resources </li>
	<li>Evaluation and quality control of treebanks </li>
	<li>Tools for creation and management of treebanks </li>
	<li>Treebanks for lesser-resourced languages </li>
	<li>Theories, schemas and applications for parallel treebanks </li>
	<li>Standards for treebanks </li>
	<li>(Semi-)automatic methods for creating large treebanks </li>
	<li>Mapping of treebanks to Linked Open Data resources </li>
	<li>Domain-specific treebanks </li>
	<li>The future of treebanks and treebanking </li>
	<li>Multi-word expressions in treebanks </li>
	<li>Language-universal annotation for treebanks and its relation to language-specific annotation</li>
	<li>Relation of treebanking to linguistic typology</li>
</ul>

<h2>Special topic</h2>

<p>This year, we specifically invite papers on all aspects of the relation of linguistically motivated complex annotation, such as treebanking, and deep learning methods. Topics of such papers may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a comparison of application performance using a linguistic representation vs. end-to-end Deep Neural Network system, or any particular aspects of it (e.g., differences in recall vs. precision)</li>
	<li>analysis of errors made by a deep-learning system vs. a system using linguistic features or representation</li>
	<li>approaches to "soften" categorical annotation usually present in treebanks by using distributional methods</li>
	<li>specific aspects of deep learning when applied to complex treebanks</li>
	<li>advantages or disadvantages of deep learning from treebanks in a multilingual setting.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions for authors</h2>

<p>The program for TLT16 will consist of full papers, posters and software demonstrations. 
	This year, we ask authors <b>not</b> to anonymize their submissions; 
we believe that full anonymity is difficult to achieve, since many papers now appear as preprints on the web and it is easy to find authors; 
	for demonstrations, it is almost impossible in any case due to the use of system names, references to previous versions etc. 
	Submissions must be written in English, and conform to the TLT16 style files available at
<a href="http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/tlt16/style-tlt16.zip">http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/tlt16/style-tlt16.zip</a>.</p>

<p>All submissions should be full-length papers of up to 7 pages plus unlimited references. 
It is assumed that system demonstration papers might be shorter; 
	in any case, use an appropriate length given what is the idea you are conveying in your contribution and the amount of technical details and/or examples you want to put in. 
	Accepted final papers will get an extra page (8 pages total) plus unlimited number of pages for references 
	and up to 4 pages for an optional appendix which could serve to publish algorithms, code snippets 
	and/or additional examples.</p>

<p>The organizers will work with the ACL Anthology to list the TLT proceedings there. 
	Authors of outstanding papers as identified by the PC members will be invited to submit an extended version 
	to The Prague Bulletin of Mathematical Linguistics (<a href="https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pbml">https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pbml</a>), 
	an ERIH-Plus listed journal published online by deGruyter in cooperation with Charles University.</p>

<p>Please upload your submissions via EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tlt16">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tlt16</a></p>
